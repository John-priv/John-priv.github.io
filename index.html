        <h2>Projects</h2>

        <h3>Security System</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Computer Vision team lead</li>
            <li>The computer vision code was running on a Zedboard</li>
            <li>Used OpenCV's HOG Descriptors to detect people in a camera frame</li>
            <li>Coordinates of detected people are pushed to a queue and forwarded from the camera system to a remote
                base system</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>JPEG Compression in Hardware</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Implemented the DCT, quantization, dequantization, and IDCT steps of the JPEG algorithm on an FPGA</li>
            <ul>
                <li>FPGA was on a Xilinx PYNQ board</li>
                <li>The PYNQ board was also running a Jupyter notebook</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Vivado's HLS C was used for programming the FPGA</li>
            <li>Python was used for supporting functions:
                <ul>
                    <li>Importing images</li>
                    <li>Generating 8x8 pixel chunks for DCT and quantization</li>
                    <li>Streaming the pixel chunks to and from the FPGA</li>
                    <li>Recombining the output chunks into a compressed image</li>
                </ul>
        </ul>

        <h3>Bluetooth Robotic Arm</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Synchronized a robotic arm to a Wii remote</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Light/Alcohol Seeking Robot</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Implemented C++ code on an Arduino for an autonomous robot that avoids obstacles and
                detects light or alcohol</li>
            <li>Developed an efficient search algorithm for robot movement using custom Matlab
                simulations</li>
        </ul>

    TODO:<br>
    - Add very basic CSS to the website<br>
    - Center the website (so that it loads/is readable on all devices)<br>
    - Add tabs to top of website: About, Projects (with sub tabs), Experience (Work), Resume, some form of contact/education/misc<br>
    - Figure out if the "Experience" section will use paragraphs or list elements
    - Download javascript<br>
    - Add javascript<br>
    - OPTIONAL: Add simple animations to the website (tabs scrolling down when hovering)<br>
    - OPTIONAL: Figure out if it is possible for images to be processed after text<br>
    - OPTIONAL: Add videos for project demos<br>
    - Remove everything in this TODO section after tabs and stuff are added
</p> -->

        Note: This website is currently a work in progress. All elements in here are stubs that will be expanded upon
        later on (after more of the website is developed).<br>
