NOTE: This website is currently a work in progress. All elements in here are stubs that will be expanded upon later on (after more of the website is developed)<br>

<p>
    TODO:<br>
    - Add very basic CSS to the website<br>
    - Center the website (so that it loads/is readable on all devices)<br>
    - Add tabs to top of website: About, Projects (with sub tabs), Experience (Work), Resume, some form of contact/education/misc<br>
    - Download javascript<br>
    - Add javascript<br>
    - OPTIONAL: Add simple animations to the website (tabs scrolling down when hovering)<br>
    - OPTIONAL: Figure out if it is possible for images to be processed after text<br>
    - OPTIONAL: Add videos for project demos<br>
    <!-- TODO: Remove everything in this TODO section after tabs and stuff are added -->
